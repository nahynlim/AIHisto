This senior design project develops an AI-driven histomorphometric platform to quantify cell heterogeneity through collagen organization using SHG and two-photon microscopy images. By adapting the VAMPIRE framework, the platform enables automated, high-throughput morphological analysis with improved segmentation accuracy, reduced user bias, and enhanced reproducibility.
